This directory was constructed to reproduct the same environment in trunks for
the bigbang apacheds branch.  This is done to allow things like the proper 
generation of eclipse descriptors and to be able to build from top down.

The following versions and branches are associated with projects in this folder.
If there are any questions just take a look at the svn:externals set in this 
folder.

apacheds bigbang 1.5
daemon bigbangg 1.1 
shared bigbang 0.9.7 
installers bigbang 1.0
project bigbang 1.0


WARNING: 

   There are going to be massive changes to this branch as refactor a large 
   aspect of the server.  As a result the branch may not produce functioning
   or compliant versions of the server.  Heck it might not even build.  So 
   keep this in mind if you're brave enough to use this code.
