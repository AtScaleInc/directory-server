Thanks to Atlassian we have a CI setup for ApacheDS trunk and ApacheDS 1.0.  The
build is triggered when the revision number for the checkout directory changes.
A check for this occurs every 180 seconds.  So to induce a change to trigger
the build you should change this file: i.e. just increment the build number in
here.  The reason why changes in the directories do not result in a build are
due to the use of externals.

Here's the URL for the CI setup on Apache Directory Trunk:

Build Number: 11
