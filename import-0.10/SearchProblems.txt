            Problems With The Search Operation
--------------------------------------------------------------

* The following search parameters are not taken into account:

    - timeLimit
    - sizeLimit
    - typesOnly
    - derefAliases

* Pruning of undefined filter assertions does not occur.
  This must happen to facilitate the behavoir defined for
  searches with invalid filter expressions in accordance
  with RFC 2251.

* Alias dereferencing obviously from the list above is not 
  supported at the present moment.

* Referals are not supported at all by the search processor
  at the present moment.

* The search entry responses do not add binary flags in the 
  attribute description for binary attributes.

* Note that all requests except for abandon and unbind (which
  do not return responses) can return a referal to find the 
  target entry.  Only the search requests manage the resolution
  of referals and aliases.

* Extensible matching is not enabled.

* Undefined filter assertion pruning is not performed.

* The attribute list to return is not supported and all 
  including operational attributes are returned.  We need to
  return all attributes (but not operational attributes) if 
  the attribute list is empty or has a "*" wild card (which 
  returns operational attributes as well.

* Need to recognize the special reserved "1.1" attribute OID 
  in the attribute list to connotate the return of none of the 
  attributes in the entry.



                   Other Protocol Violations
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Notice of Disconnect not implemented.

* Referal error not returned when base Dn of operation is a 
  referal.

* LDAP URLs are not supported with the '%' escape syntax of 
  RFC 1738.

* Control criticality is not checked on unrecognized controls.
