Description: LDAP Server
 ApacheDS is an embeddable directory server entirely written in Java, which 
 has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it 
 supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed 
 to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world of 
 LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.
