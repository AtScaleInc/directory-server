/**
 * A server side schema aware wrapper around a large streamed value.
 * For all practical purposes values of this type are treated like
 * referrals.  They reference some value which could not fit without
 * issue into main memory.  Instead the value is referred to using a
 * URI.  This has implications on the semantics of various Value
 * operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     URI get() does not return the value but a URI referring to the value located
 *     in some streamable target location.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     set(URI) likewise sets the location target where the value can be streamed
 *     from rather than setting the actual value.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     @todo need to reflect upon this some more
 *     Don't know if getNormalizedValue() is even relavent but I guess the
 *     same URI can be represented in many ways if it is not already in canonical form
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     @todo need to reflect upon this some more
 *     isValid() is also uncessary since really this does not mean the actual value
 *     stored where pointed to by the URI is actually valid.  I think this is a reason
 *     why the server must suspend certain checks for blobs like this.  Blobs should be
 *     binary and cannot be used for naming.  Hence because they cannot be used for
 *     naming then they should not need to have matchingRules and can just use the
 *     default binary matching.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     compareTo() is relative to the URI and not the actual streamed value stored at
 *     the URI target.  This means another means is needed to determine ordering for
 *     the wrapped streamed values.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * NOTE: this implementation of ServerValue<T> is still a work in progress!!!
