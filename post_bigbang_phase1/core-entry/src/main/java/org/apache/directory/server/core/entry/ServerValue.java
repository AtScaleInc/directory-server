/**
 * A server side entry value wrapper.  Server side value wrappers are
 * schema aware, knowing the attributeType of the attributes which contain them,
 * and hence they are capable of things like:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>producing, caching and invalidate normalized versions of their wrapped values</li>
 *   <li>
 *     determining if the wrapped value complies with the syntax of their associated
 *     attributeType
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     comparing wrapped values on the basis of their cannonical representation which
 *     utilizes the matchingRules of the attributeType associated with these server
 *     side values
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These characteristics have a major impact on how these objects are treated in
 * containers: compared (ordered), hashed, added, removed, and looked up. Furthermore
 * a great advantage is gained in simplifying code which must deal with values based
 * on their associated schema.  A large portion of the value managing code which is
 * setup to compare and test values can now be avoided.
