    <section name="Server Authentication">
      <subsection name="Status">
        <p>
          Presently the directory server supports only simple authentication
          and anonymous binds while storing passwords in clear text within
          userPassword attributes in user entries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within a short while we'll be able to store passwords using the
          authPassword property which uses strong one way hashes for
          authentication such as MD5 and SHA1.  These schemes and the schema
          used are described in detail here in <a href=
          "http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3112.html">RFC 3112</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="What password do I use?">
        <p>
          So you just downloaded the server and fired her up.  Now you're
          wondering how to get an LDAP client like jxplorer, gq, or ldapbrowser
          to bind to the server over the wire.
        </p>

        <p>
          By default the super user or admin account is created when the system
          partition is created under the ou=system naming context.  This occurs
          when the server is started for the first time.  The admin user can be
          found under the following DN:
        </p>

        <source>
          uid=admin,ou=system
        </source>

        <p>
          The password is initially set to <b>secret</b>.  You might want to
          change this after starting the server.  So you can bind to the server
          as this user with <b>secret</b> as the password for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you did not disable anonymous binds by setting the respective
          property (described below), then you can bind anonymously to the
          server without any username or password.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Adding and authenticating normal users">
        <p>
          A user in the server is any entry with a userPassword attribute that
          contains a clear text password.  The DN can be anything reachable
          within one of the directory partitions.  So if you add a partition to
          hang off of <code>dc=example,dc=com</code> then you can add user
          entries anywhere under this naming context or just add user entries
          under the <code>ou=system</code> naming context.  Above is an LDIF of
          a user you can add to the directory as a test user.
        </p>

        <source>
dn: uid=jdoe,ou=users,ou=system
cn: John Doe
sn: Doe
givenname: John
objectclass: top
objectclass: person
objectclass: organizationalPerson
objectclass: inetOrgPerson
ou: Human Resources
ou: People
l: Las Vegas
uid: jdoe
mail: jdoe@apachecon.comm
telephonenumber: +1 408 555 5555
facsimiletelephonenumber: +1 408 555 5556
roomnumber: 4613
userpassword: test
        </source>

        <p>
          You can download this <a href="newuser.ldif">newuser.ldif</a> file and
          use it to add the user.  If you are lazy another test user, <code>
          uid=akarasulu, ou=users, ou=system</code> already exists within the
          directory.  It is created by default.  Simply replace jdoe's DN with
          akarasulu's DN to search for this user and bind as this user.  Below
          we use the ldapadd OpenLDAP client to import the LDIF file presuming
          the server was started on port 1024 on the localhost:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapadd -a -D 'uid=admin,ou=system' -f newuser.ldif -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w secret
        </source>

        <p>
          You can confirm the add/import by performing a search for the user.
          This time using the OpenLDAP search client you use the following
          command:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapsearch -D 'uid=admin,ou=system' -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w secret -s one
    -b 'ou=users,ou=system' '(uid=jdoe)'
        </source>

        <p>
          You can start searching the directory using this new user like so:
        </p>

        <source>
ldapsearch -D 'uid=jdoe,ou=users,ou=system' -h localhost -p 1024 -x -w test -s one -b 'ou=system' '(objectClass=*)'
        </source>

      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Protecting User Passwords">
        <p>
          At the moment there's a sweet spot for new users.  This sweet
          spot is immediately under the ou=users,ou=system context.  Users
          created here are hard protected right now.  The server does not have
          a formal authorization mechanism in place yet to protect entries from
          other users.  Authorization rules have been hardcoded into the system
          for now to control access to user entries under <code>ou=users,
          ou=system</code>.  Only the admin and the user him/her self can
          access their entries for reads.  Users cannot modify their group
          membership properties but can change their own passwords.  They do
          not see each other's accounts at all.  The admin is the only one that
          can read and write anything.
        </p>

        <p>
          So in the interim you're best off adding your users to this area to
          prevent others from reading clear text password stored in userPassword
          fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that anonymous binds and binds as users show different
          views of the ou=system naming context.  So don't freak out if you
          don't see the usual suspects when binding anonymously!  Anonymous
          users cannot see the admin account or any other user accounts.  Users
          other than admin cannot see the admin account and can only see one
          user account: their own.  The admin sees everything and can alter or
          remove any entry.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Disabling Anonymous Binds">
        <p>
          Anonymous binds come enabled out of the box.  So you might want to
          turn off this feature especially since you cannot protect much of
          your data at the present moment from access using authorization rules.
          To do so you're going to have to restart the server while disallowing
          these binds.  The <b>server.disable.anonymous</b> property when
          present as a key in the enviroment (regardless of value) will disable
          access by anonymous users.  This applies to authentication via LDAP
          clients over the wire and via JNDI caller through the JNDI provider.
