/**
 * A class to store all informations about the existing
 * password found in the cache or get from the backend.
 *
 * This is necessary as we have to compute :
 * - the used algorithm
 * - the salt if any
 * - the password itself.
 *
 * If we have a on-way encrypted password, it is stored using this
 * format :
 * {<algorithm>}<encrypted password>
 * where the encrypted password format can be :
 * - MD5/SHA : base64(<password>)
 * - SMD5/SSH : base64(<salted-password-digest><salt (4 or 8 bytes)>)
 * - crypt : <salt (2 btytes)><password>
 *
 * Algorithm are currently MD5, SMD5, SHA, SSHA, SHA2, SSHA-2 (except SHA-224), CRYPT and empty
